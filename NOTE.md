### Update

The refinebio v0.0.1 has been manually published to the public npm registry under the CCDL organization scope and now publically available for installatio.

- The `package.json` has been udpated for this release and merged to dev/main
- It can be unpublished at any time, except that the same `package@version` combination won't be available(the npm registry data is immutable)

### NOTE

I sent a new invitation to your account, please accept it upon return(the old one expired). It also requires for you to setup 2FA(enforced by the CCDL account). Once it's approved, your name will show up in the `Collaborators` under the CCDL package page.
